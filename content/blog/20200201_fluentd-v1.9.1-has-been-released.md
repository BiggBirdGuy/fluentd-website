# Fluentd v1.9.1 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.9.1. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release includes several enhancements.

### http\_server helper: Support HTTPS

`http_server` helper supports HTTPS via [http\_server\_create\_https\_server](https://docs.fluentd.org/plugin-helper-overview/api-plugin-helper-http_server#http_server_create_https_server-title-addr-port-logger-default_app-nil-tls_opts-nil-and-block) method.

This is mainly for 3rd party plugin migration.

### parser\_syslog: Add multiline RFC5424 support

`parser_syslog` with `rfc5424` mode can parse multiline messages now.

```
<16>1 2017-02-06T13:14:15.003Z 192.168.0.1 fluentd - - - Hi,\nfrom\nFluentd!
```

Above log can be parsed correctly.

### out\_http: Add warning for `retryable_response_codes`

We have a plan to remove `503` from `retryable_response_codes`'s default value since fluentd v2.

If you want to keep `503`, set it explicitly in configuration.

### Major bug fixes

- tls: Fix TLS version handling in secure mode
- output: Add `EncodingError` to unrecoverable errors

Enjoy logging!
