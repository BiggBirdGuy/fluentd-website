Hi users!

We have just released Fluentd version 0.12.3.
Here are the changes:

#### New features / Enhancement

* parser: `nginx` and `apache2` format can now parse access log without http-version: [#535](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/535)
* filter\_record\_transformer: Allow non-string values like array / hash: [#530](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/530)
* plugin: Add writable check for path related parameter: [#401](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/401)
* command: `-g` and `-G` now works in embedded Ruby environment like Treasure Agent: [#423](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/423)

#### Bug fixes

* buffer: Fix to flush a buffer by USR1 signal even on retrying: [#531](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/531)
* buffer: Fix TimeSlicedOutput doesn't flush with SIGUSR1: [#533](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/533)
* buffer: Fix broken `calc_retry_wait` if Integer is used for `retry_wait` parameter: [#529](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/529)
* engine: Fix SIGHUP does not reload config: [#537](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/537)

This release is mainly for improving stability.

### Support array / hash values in record\_transformer filter

In old `record_transfomer` filter, values in `<record>` becomes string value.
For example, if you have following configuration,

```aconf
<filter debug.**>
  type record_transformer
  <record>
    hash {  
      "hostname": "${hostname}",
      "tag": "${tag}"
    }
  </record>
</filter>
<match debug.**>
  type stdout
</match>
```

We got a stringized result, not hash.

    2015-01-16 00:10:20 +0900 debug.test: {"k":"v","hash":"{\"hostname\":\"server1\",\"tag\":\"debug.test\"}"}

Since this version, got hash value like below.

    2015-01-16 00:10:20 +0900 debug.test: {"k":"v","hash":{"hostname":"server1","tag":"debug.test"}}


### Improve buffer related signal handling

In old version, fluentd waits retry wait even if received USR1 signal.
From now, fluentd flushes buffers immediately.

In addition, [TimeSlicedOutput](http://docs.fluentd.org/articles/buffer-plugin-overview#time-sliced-plugin-overview) plugin, e.g. out\_file, also flushes buffers by USR1.


Happy logging!
