# Fluentd v1.13.1 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.13.1. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1131---20210625).

This release is a maintenance release of v1.13 series.

### `in_tail`: Fixed to remove too much verbose debugging logs

It was unexpectedly introduced by [#3185](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3185) - log throttling feature in v1.13.0.
In this release, too much verbose debug logging was removed.

It has nothing to do with it when you didn't use `in_tail` with debug level.

### Upgrade attention for TD Agent users

If you use Fluentd v1.12 or later, we recommend to use at least v1.12.4 or later.
It is because `in_tail` contains serious bugs in it.

Note that even latest td-agent 4.1.1 also ships a buggy Fluentd v1.12.3.
You should upgrade bundled Fluentd by yourself.
This issue will be fixed in the future release of td-agent.

```
$ sudo td-agent-gem install fluentd --version=1.13.1
```

Enjoy logging!
