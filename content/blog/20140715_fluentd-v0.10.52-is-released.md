* Add --without-source option to ignore \<source> sections: [#377](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/377)

This release improves V1 configuration.
Now you can write `#` comment in array and hash types.

```aconf
<source>
  attr { 
    # k1 is for foo
    "k1": "v1",
    "k2": "v2"  # k2 is for bar
  }
</source>
```

In addition, now `@` prefix is not allowed in the parameter name. `@` prefix will be used for Filter and Label supports.

`--without-source` option is for flushing buffered events. You can invoke Fluentd process without input plugins. See [issue #279](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/279) for more details.


Happy logging!
