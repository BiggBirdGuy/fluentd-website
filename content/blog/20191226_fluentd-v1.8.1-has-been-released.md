# Fluentd v1.8.1 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.8.1. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### out\_copy: Add `copy_mode` parameter

`out_copy` has `deep_copy` parameter but `deep_copy` is misleading name.
This uses shallow copy via ruby's `dup` method and this is not fit for nested field case.

`copy_mode` resolves this problem. `copy_mode` parameter provides `shallow` and `deep`.
If you need to mutate nested field after `out_copy`, you can use `copy_mode deep`.
See also [official out_copy article](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/copy#copy_mode).

`deep_copy` parameter is now deprecated.

### Major bug fixes

- parser_ltsv: Prevent garbage result by checking `label_delimiter`


Enjoy logging!
