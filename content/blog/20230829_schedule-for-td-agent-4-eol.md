# Drop schedule announcement about EOL of Treasure Agent (td-agent) 4

Hi users and developers!

We announce the dropping schedule for TD Agent 4 development.

## About Treasure Agent (td-agent) 4

Since td-agent 4.0.0 was released in 2020, td-agent 4 has been maintained for a long time.

As new major version of td-agent 4 was rebranded (to `fluent-package` v5), and released in August 2023,
we decided to stop maintaining td-agent 4.

## Scheduled end of life - Dec 2023

As you know, already stepping down maintenance activity, new minor update for td-agent 4 will not be shipped anymore.
(td-agent v4.5.1 will be the last release of this series, it will be shipped in this month.)

Thus, we recommend using fluent-package v5 for new deployment :)

## How to migrate to Fluent Package v5

There is a good article to do it.

* [Upgrade to fluent-package v5](upgrade-td-agent-v4-to-v5)

Follow the above instructions.
