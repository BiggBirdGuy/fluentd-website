# Fluentd v1.16.6 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.16.6 on 2024-08-20. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/v1.16/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1166---20240816).

This release is a maintenance release of v1.16 series.
In this release, some bugs were fixed with backporting from v1.17.x.

## Bug Fixes

### `yaml_parser`: `$log_level` notation in YAML was supported

In this release, we added a support for `$log_level` in [YAML config file syntax](https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/config-file-yaml).

In the previous versions, if you used `log_level` in YAML configuration, it causes a following warning:


```
[warn]: #0 'log_level' is deprecated parameter name. use '@log_level' instead.
```

But `@log_level` is invalid in YAML format. In YAML format, it should be `$log_level` as same as 
similar parameter such as `$tag` and `$type`, but not supported before.

Since Fluentd v1.16.6, `$log_level` has been supported! (In v1.17.x, it was supported since v1.17.1)

### fluentd command: Fix `--plugin` (-p) option not to overwrite default value

In this release, we have fixed a bug that fluentd command: `--plugin` (-p) option could not overwrite default value.

This bug was unexpectedly introduced since v1.16.0.

Now it was reverted to the original behavior.

### logger: Fix LoadError with console gem v1.25

In this release, we fixed a LoadError with console gem v1.25 or later.

Since console gem v1.25 or later, it's internal change causes a LoadError in Fluentd.
This error breaks existing plugin such as fluent-plugin-prometheus which provides monitoring REST API.

* [500 response when scraping prometheus metrics in kubernetes with istio service mesh](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/4576)

With supporting console gem v1.25 or later, this issue has solved!

Enjoy logging!
