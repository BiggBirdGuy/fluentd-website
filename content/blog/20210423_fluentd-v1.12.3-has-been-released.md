# Fluentd v1.12.3 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.12.3. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### `TLSServer`: Enable TCP keep-alive support for TLS connections

TLS implementation was updated to allow the use of `send_keepalive_packet`. This feature can be used to detect dropped TLS connections, and to prevent them from consuming too much system resource.

```
<source>
  @type forward
  send_keepalive_packet true
  <transport tls>
    cert_path /path/to/fluentd.crt
    ...
  </transport>
</source>
```

### `TLSServer`: Show peer information on connection errors

Starting from this version, Fluentd will includes the client information when it fails to establish a secure connection, to ease the diagnosis of TLS-related problems (such as invalid client certs).

```
2021-04-23 17:35:03 +0900 [warn]: #0 unexpected error before accepting TLS connection by OpenSSL host="127.0.0.1" port=34634 error_class=OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError error="SSL_accept returned=1 errno=0 state=error: tlsv1 alert unknown ca
```

### `in_tail`: Fix IO error handling on Windows system

Previously, `in_tail` had a bug that reports a bogus IO error code on the Windows platform (e.g. reports `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` on missing files).

Starting from this version, `in_tail` will retrieve Windows error codes correctly, and show much more descriptive messages for them.

```
Fluent::Win32Error: code: 32, The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. - C:\file.txt",
```

### `in_tail`: Handle short-lived log files correctly

Fluentd v1.12.2 had a race-condition bug that throws an uncatched exception on short-lived files [#3327](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/3327). This version contains a fix for the issue.

### Miscellaneous bug fixes

 * Fix `parser_type` symbol conflicts in `parser_csv` and `parser_syslog`. [#3302](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/3302)
 * Fix position file corruption issue on concurrent gracefulReloads [#3335](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3335)
 * Fix incorrect warnings about `${chunk_id}` with `out_s3` [#3339](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3339)

Enjoy logging!
