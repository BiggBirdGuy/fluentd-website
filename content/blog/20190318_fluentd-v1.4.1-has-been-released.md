# Fluentd v1.4.1 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.4.1. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release includes several enhancements and bug fixes.

### system: Add `worker_id` to `process_name` when workers is larger than 1

This improves the multi-workers operation.

    <system>
      process_name fluentd_aggr
      workers 2
    </system>

With this configuration, older version shows same process name for workers.

    # ps result
    repeatedly       94982   0.0  0.2  2521484  29948 s004  S+    9:56PM   0:00.48 worker:fluentd_aggr  
    repeatedly       94983   0.0  0.2  2522508  28304 s004  S+    9:56PM   0:00.49 worker:fluentd_aggr

Since v1.4.1, process name has worker id to identify the process.

    # ps result
    repeatedly       94879   0.0  0.2  2522508  28808 s004  S+    9:55PM   0:00.49 worker:fluentd_aggr0
    repeatedly       94880   0.0  0.2  2521484  29084 s004  S+    9:55PM   0:00.49 worker:fluentd_aggr1

### Major bug fixes

* out\_forward: Make `tls_client_private_key_passphrase` secret
* in\_syslog: Check message length when read from buffer in octet counting

Enjoy logging!
