# Fluentd v1.10.2 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.10.2. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release fixes several bugs.

### socket: Allow certificate chains in client certificate

`socket` helper based plugin now accepts certificate chains for client certificate.
For example, out\_forward's `tls_client_cert_path` now accepts certificate chains.

### log: Add `ignore_repeated_log_interval` parameter

Specify interval to ignore repeated log/stacktrace messages like below.

```
<system>
  ignore_repeated_log_interval 2s
</system>
```

Under high-load environment, output destination sometimes becomes unstable and
it generates lots of logs with same message. This parameter mitigates such situation.

### Major bug fixes

- out\_forward: Fix obsolete socket leak when `keepalive_timeout` is not set
- command: Fix regression of supervisor's worker and `--daemon` option combo
- command: Fix `fluent-debug` start failure

Enjoy logging!
