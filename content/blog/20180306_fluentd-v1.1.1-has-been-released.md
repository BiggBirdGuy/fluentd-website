# Fluentd v1.1.1 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.1.1. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release includes several enhancements and bug fixes..

### in_forward/server helper: Support mutual TLS authentication

We added `ca_path` and `client_cert_path` parameters to `server` plugin helper.
You can now send data between fluent-bit and fluentd with mutual TLS authentication.
In `in_forward`, put these parameters into `<transport tls>`.

```
<source>
  @type forward
  # ... other parameters
  <transport tls>
    # ... other parameters
    ca_path /path/to/ca_file
    client_cert_auth true
  </transport>
</source>
```

### buf_file: Skip and delete broken chunk files during resume

fluentd can't restart if unexpected broken file exist in buffer directory, because such files cause errors in resume routine.
Since v1.1.1, if fluentd found broken chunks during resume, these files are skipped and deleted from buffer directory.

We have a plan to add backup feature for broken files in v1.2.0. It moves broken files into backup directory instead of deletion.

### Major bug fixes

* json parser: Fix error handling for oj 3.x
* in_tail: Fix watcher race condition during shutdown
* in_http: Emit event time instead of raw time value in batch mode

Thanks for submitting bug reports and patches :)

Enjoy logging!
