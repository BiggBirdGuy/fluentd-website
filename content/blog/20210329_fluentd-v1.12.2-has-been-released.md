# Fluentd v1.12.2 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.12.2. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### `out_copy`: Add a new attribute `ignore_if_prev_successes`

You can start using `ignore_if_prev_successes` to define fallback outputs. Fluentd will make use of these destinations if (and only if) the preceding outputs failed.

```
<store ignore_error>
  @type test
  name c0
</store>
<store ignore_if_prev_success ignore_error>
  @type test
  name c1
</store>
<store ignore_if_prev_success>
  @type test
  name c2
</store>
```

### time-format: Add a new option `time_format_fallbacks`

Fluentd is now able to handle a heterogeneous time field. For example, if your timestamp field is mostly unixtime, but sometimes formatted in iso8601, you can specify as follows:

```
time_type mixed
time_format_fallbacks unixtime, %iso8601
```

### `formatter_ltsv`: Safe delimiter character handling

To prevent LTSV data from being corrupted, we've started to substitute a delimiter character in records with a safe replacement. You can fine-tune the behaviour using `replacement` option as follows:

```
<format>
  @type ltsv
  replacement " "
</format>
```


### Several `in_tail` stability fixes 

Weâ€™ve fixed several `in_tail` stability issues:

* in_tail may not send rotated logs when mv is used to rotate [#3292](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/3292)
* in_tail crashes worker upon ENOENT [#3274](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/3274)

### `out_forward`: Fix duplication logs at shutdown

Fluentd now waits ack responses in the shutdown phase correctly [#3137](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/3137).

### Project Maintenance

* Our community forum has been moved to [Discuss](https://discuss.fluentd.org/). Google group is deprecated.
* We've migrated CI from Travis CI and AppVeyor to GitHub Actions [#3281](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3281) [#3290](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3290)
* We greet new maintainers from [ClearCode Inc](https://www.clear-code.com/). [#3282](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3282)

Enjoy logging!
