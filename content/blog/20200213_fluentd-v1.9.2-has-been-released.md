This release includes several enhancements.

### in_tail: Add `pos_file_compaction_interval` parameter for auto compaction

With `pos_file_compaction_interval 10m`, in_tail removes unwatched file from `pos_file` entries
at 10m intervals. This feature is for short-live and lots of containers environment.
