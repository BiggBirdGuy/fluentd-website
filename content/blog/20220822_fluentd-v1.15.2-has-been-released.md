# Fluentd v1.15.2 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.15.2. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1152---20220822).

In this release, we fixed the problem that `out_file`'s append mode with `--daemon` flag failed to flush the buffer.

## Bug Fixes

### `out_file`: Fix append mode with `--daemon` flag

In the previous version v1.15.1, we added a new feature to prevent write conflicts between multiple workers.

* [#3808](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3808)

However, this fix didn't work correctly with `--daemon` flag of Fluentd command.

* [Command Line Option](https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/command-line-option)

With that flag, `out_file` in the append mode fails to flush the buffer.
This is a critical bug for td-agent, because td-agent uses `--daemon` flag by default.

In this release, we fixed this problem.

See [#3864](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3864) for more information.

## Miscellaneous fixes

* Add a new system configuration `enable_jit`. [#3857](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3857)
* child_process: Plug file descriptor leak. [#3844](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3844)
* Drop win32-api gem to support Ruby 3.2. [#3849](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3849), [#3866](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3866)

Enjoy logging!
