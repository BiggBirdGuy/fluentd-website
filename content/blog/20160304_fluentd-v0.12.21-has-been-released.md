## in\_tail: Stop reading logs until buffer fill is resolved

Recently, we added `buffer_queue_full_action` parameter to prevent event drop by `BufferQueueLimitError` without `@ERROR` label. `buffer_queue_full_action` affects all input plugins so setting `buffer_queue_full_action` is sometimes not answer when use several input plugins and one output destination.

`in_tail` is most used plugin so `in_tail` should care `BufferQueueLimitError`. Now `in_tail` stop reading logs when receive `BufferQueueLimitError` during emit action without `buffer_queue_full_action block`. <br />
`in_tail` keeps to ignore other errors in emit action, e.g. output plugin can't handle emitted event. In such cases, use `@ERROR` label instead.

## filter\_record\_transformer: Fix race condition

```
<source>
  @type tail
  tag foo.bar
</source>

<source>
  @type tail
  tag foo.baz
</source>

<filter foo.**>
  @type record_transformer
  <record>
    field1 ${tag_parts[1]}
  </record>
</record>
```

If you share one `record_transformer` between several input plugins like above, `record_transformer` had a race condition. `field1` is sometimes mixed, e.g. `foo.bar` event may have `baz` in `field1`. We fixed this problem.

<br />
Lastly, v0.12.21 docker image has also been [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/tags).

<br />
Happy logging!
