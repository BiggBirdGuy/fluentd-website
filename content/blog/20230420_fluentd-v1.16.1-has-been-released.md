# Fluentd v1.16.1 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.16.1 on 2023-04-17. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1161---20230417).

In the previous version v1.16.0, there was a bug that caused Fluentd to fail to start with certain secondary configurations.
In this release, we fixed that problem and added a new feature of `in_tcp`.
And other some improvements!

## Enhancement

* `in_tcp`: Add `message_length_limit` to drop large incoming data. [#4137](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4137)

## Bug Fixes

### `out_secondary_file`: Fix NameError of `SecondaryFileOutput` when setting other secondaries

In the previous version v1.16.0, there was a bug that if you set another secondary without ever setting `out_secondary_file`, Fluentd fails to start with the following error.

```
/path/to/fluentd/lib/fluent/plugin/output.rb:429:in `configure': uninitialized constant Fluent::Plugin::Output::SecondaryFileOutput (NameError)

          if (@secondary.class != SecondaryFileOutput) &&
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

In this release, we fixed this problem.

See [#4124](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4124) for more information.

### `Buffer`: Fix that `compress` setting causes unexpected error when receiving already compressed MessagePack

With this release, it is now possible that Fluentd forwards already compressed MessagePack data to another Fluentd as is (without decompressing).

A possible use case is two-stage forwarding.

Forwarder1(`out_forward`) -> Forwarder2(`in_forward`, `out_forward`) -> Aggregator(`in_forward`)

In this case, Forwarder2 should process the data of `CompressedMessagePackEventStream` as is (without decompressing) and re-forward the data to Aggregator.

Until this version, a bug prevented us from setting Forwarder2's `compress gzip` of [out_forward](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/forward#how-to-enable-gzip-compression) or [buffer](https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/buffer-section#buffering-parameters).
It resulted in the following error.

```
[error]: #0 unexpected error on reading data host="..." port=... error_class=ArgumentError error="unknown keyword: :packer"
```

So we had no choice but to decompress and forward it from Forwarder2 to Aggregator.

With this release, we can now set `compress gzip` for Forwarder2!

See [#4146](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/4146) and [#4147](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4147) for more information.

### Others

* Server helper: Suppress error of `UDPServer` over `max_bytes` on Windows. [#4131](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4131)

Enjoy logging!
