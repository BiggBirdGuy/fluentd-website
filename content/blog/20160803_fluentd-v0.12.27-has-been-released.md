## config: Add simplified syntax for hash and array

Currently, we need to write json array / object for `array` / `hash` type parameters. Since v0.12.27, we introduced new short-hand syntax to write values easily.

Here is an example. If you have a following plugin:

```rb
class FooInput < Fluent::Input
  Fluent::Plugin.register_input('foo', self)

  config_param :array_param, :array
  config_param :hash_param, :hash

  # ...
end
```

You can write the configuration below:

```
<source>
  @type foo
  array_param 1,2,3  # same as ["1", "2", "3"]
  hash_param x:1,y:2 # same as {"x":1, "y":2}
</source>
```

For `array` type parameter, plugin authors easy to migrate string type to array type without configuration change.

## in\_syslog: Add `message_length_limit` option to receive longer udp syslog messages:

The max received size of older in\_syslog is 2048. This doesn't work with longer log line.
We added `message_length_limit` parameter to change the received size for longer logs.


<br />
Lastly, v0.12.27 docker image has also been [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/tags).

<br />
Happy logging!
