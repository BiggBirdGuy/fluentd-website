# Fluentd v0.12.5 is released

Hi users!

We have just released Fluentd version 0.12.5.
Here are the changes:

#### New features / Enhancement

* in\_tail: Enable multiline mode if format contains 'multiline': [#545](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/545)
* event: Improve `EventStream#to_msgpack_stream` performance: [#549](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/549)
* engine: Add tag information to emit log

#### Bug fixes

* Update msgpack dependency to avoid incompatible encoding problem: [#550](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/550)

### Update msgpack-ruby dependency to v0.5.11 or later.

We found msgpack-ruby v0.5 has a bug when object has a large string.
Old msgpack-ruby v0.5 raises `Encoding::CompatibilityError` in this case.

Fix commit: [Fixed Encoding::CompatibilityError under certain condition.](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-ruby/commit/db58d34c17e689b585db14f8c37a0d8c665d4024)

If you see above error in fluentd logs, we recommend to update msgpack to latest version.

### multiline mode support in in_tail

Since this version, `in_tail` uses multiline mode when format contains `multiline` word.
CSV example is in [#543 PR](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/543).
Any API feedback is welcome!


Fluentd v0.10.60 is also released with same changes.

Happy logging!
