# Fluentd v0.14.23 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v0.14.23. This release is mainly for bug fix.
Here are the changes of v0.14.23([full ChangeLog is available here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))

### in_udp: Add `remove_newline` parameter

Current `in_udp` removes the newline from the end of incoming payload. This is for one line log processing.
But originally, UDP is message-oriented and no need such processing.
In addition, this behaviour is not good for binary message.

So we add `remove_newline` parameter to control this behaviour. Default is `true` for the compatibility,
but we will change the default value to `false` after 6-months transition period.

### Major bug fixes

* `in_tcp`: Fix log corruption under load.

`in_tcp` shared the buffer between connections and it has a log corruption problem under high load.
New implementation has a buffer inside the connection so the problem is fixed.<br />
Patch from @AM-iain. Thanks!

* `out_forward`: Fix elapsed time miscalculation in tcp heartbeat

TCP heartbeat misjudges the server failure when one of server in `<server>`s has a problem.
It causes detaching active destination from target server list. We fixed this problem by changing elapsed time calculation routine.<br />
UDP heartbeat doesn't have this problem.


We will release v0.12.41 with several backports soon.
Enjoy logging!
