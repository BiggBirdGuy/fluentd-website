# Fluentd v1.7.4 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.7.4. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release is mainly for fixing bugs.

### in\_http: Add `use_204_response` parameter

This change follows RFC7231. For zero-length payload, `204` is better than `200`.

```
<source>
  @type http
  # other parameters
  use_204_response true
</source>
```

This parameter will be removed at fluentd v2 and `in_http` will return `204`.

### Major bug fixes

- child_process helper: fix stderr blocking for discard case
- log: Fix log rotation handling on Windows. This changes log filename.
  See https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/logging#log-rotation-setting


Enjoy logging!
