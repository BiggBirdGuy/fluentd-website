# Fluentd v1.0.2 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.0.2. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This announcement includes v1.0.1 changes.

### in\_udp: Add receive\_buffer\_size parameter

This parameter is corresponding to `SO_RCVBUF` of socket.
If you want to improve the performance of `in_udp`, set larger size to this parameter.

### Major bug fixes

* in_tail: Handle truncated/moved back case

  In `rename(file -> file.bak) -> truncate -> rename(file.bak -> file)` case, fluentd reads logs from the bottom.
  It causes log lost when application appends logs after `truncate`. Latest version reads logs from the head.

* out_forward: Rebuild weight array to apply server setting on active/standby environment

  After active node is backed, standby node was still listed in active nodes.
  v1.0.2 fixes this regression. standby node is excluded from active nodes properly.

We have released v0.12.42 together. v0.12.42 includes same bug fixes.

Enjoy logging!
