# Fluentd v1.15.1 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.15.1. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1151---20220727).

This release is a maintenance release of v1.15 series.

## Bug Fixes

### `out_file`: Add support for concurrent append

Using ["append" option](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/file#append) of `out_file` in multiple
workers could cause file corruption due to write conflicts.
This could happen when multiple workers append to the same file at the same time, although it was
very rare.

In this release, we add a lock-system to Fluentd to prevents write conflicts between multiple workers.

This prevents write conflicts of `out_file`.

See [#3808](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3808) for more information.

## Miscellaneous bug fixes

* `in_tail`: Show more information on skipping update_watcher. [#3829](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3829)

Enjoy logging!
