# Fluentd v1.2.1 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.2.1. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release is mainly for bug fixes.

## Counter API: Add `wait` to Client

This is handy API for error check. Using `get`, you need to check error response from the response body.
`wait` raises an exception when API call has a problem.

```
require 'fluent/plugin/filter'

module Fluent
  module Plugin
    class CounterFilter < Filter
      Plugin.register_filter('counter', self)

      helpers :counter

      def start
        super

        @client = counter_client_create(scope: 'test')
        @client.establish('counter')
        # if init call returns an error, exception is raised
        begin
          @client.init(:name => 'num', type: 'numeric', reset_interval: 10).wait
        rescue Fluent::Counter::BaseError
          # process client specific error
        end
      end

      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

### Major bug fixes

* in_tcp/in_udp: Fix source_hostname_key to set hostname correctly
* out_file: Temporal fix for broken gzipped files with `gzip` and `append true`

Thanks for submitting bug reports and patches :)

Enjoy logging!
