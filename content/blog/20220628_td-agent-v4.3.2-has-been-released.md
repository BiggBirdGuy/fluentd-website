# td-agent v4.3.2 has been released

We have released td-agent v4.3.2.
This release is mainly for supporting new distributions released in 2022Q2.
We choose Ruby 3.1 to bundle for such new distributions to adopt to recent
environment such as OpenSSL 3.0. For other distributions, we still use
Ruby 2.7. We'll migrate to Ruby 3 completely after Ruby 3.2 is released.
