# Fluentd v1.14.6 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.14.6. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1146---20220331).

This release is a maintenance release of v1.14 series.

## Enhancement

### Enable server plugins to specify socket-option `SO_LINGER`

In this release, we add a new option `linger_timeout` to `server` plugin-helper
so that we can specify `SO_LINGER` socket-option when using TCP or TLS server function of the helper.

The helper has used `0` as `linger_timeout` value, and it makes the server send RST
rather than FIN on the connection closing.
We can specify a positive value to send FIN on closing.

This new option is in `transport` section, and we can specify this for plugins
using TCP or TLS server function of the helper, such as `in_tcp`, `in_http`,
`in_syslog`, and `in_forward`. 

```
<source>
  @type tcp
  ...
  <parse>
    ...
  </parse>
  <transport tcp>
    linger_timeout 1
  </transport>
</source>
```

Only `in_forward` plugin had `linger_timeout` option before, but the option is now deprecated
and unified to `transport` section.

(TODO: Windowsの従来挙動が怪しい。もしかしたらWindowsではデフォルトでもFINが送信されるかもしれない。)

See [#3644](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3644) for more information.

### Add `--umask` to `fluentd` command line parameter

When we launch Fluentd with `--no-supervisor`, the umask value of the environment
is not applied because Fluentd overwrites the value.

In this release, We can use `--umask` option as a `fluentd` command line parameter
to specify the umask value in the case of launching Fluentd with `--no-supervisor`.

```console
$ fluentd -c {config_path} --no-supervisor --umask 002
```

See [#3671](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3671), [#3679](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3679) for more information.

## Bug Fixes

### Fix wrong calculation of retry count and interval

There was mistakes in the calculation about `exponential_backoff` retry_type.

In this release, the calculation is fixed, and the count and the interval of
retry change as following.

**Count**

* Before: At most `retry_max_times` + 1 retries were triggered.
* This release: At most `retry_max_times` retries are triggered.

**Interval**

* Before: By default, n-th retry was triggered after 2^(n-1) seconds elapsed since the **first** time.
* This release: By default, n-th retry is triggered after 2^(n-1) seconds elapsed since the **last** time.

**When to switch to secondary**

* Before: The total time calculation was wrong. Although `retry_max_times` + 1 retries were mistakenly triggered,
  `retry_secondary_threshold` was applied to the total time to the `retry_max_times`-th retry. So switching to
  secondary occurred earlier than the correct time.
* This release: `retry_secondary_threshold` is correctly applied to the total retry time.

The followings are examples.

`retry_max_times: 10`, `retry_randomize: false`

| N-th retry | Elapsed (before) | Elapsed (this release) |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|
| 1th        | 1s               | 1s                     |
| 2th        | 2s               | 3s                     |
| 3th        | 4s               | 7s                     |
| 4th        | 8s               | 15s                    |
| 5th        | 16s              | 31s                    |
| 6th        | 32s              | 63s                    |
| 7th        | 64s              | 127s                   |
| 8th        | 128s             | 255s                   |
| 9th        | 256s             | 511s                   |
| 10th       | 512s             | 1023s                  |
| 11th       | 1024s            | None                   |

`retry_max_times: 10`, `retry_randomize: false`, and use secondary output

| N-th retry | Elapsed (before) | Elapsed (this release) |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|
| 1th        | 1s               | 1s                     |
| 2th        | 2s               | 3s                     |
| 3th        | 4s               | 7s                     |
| 4th        | 8s               | 15s                    |
| 5th        | 16s              | 31s                    |
| 6th        | 32s              | 63s                    |
| 7th        | 64s              | 127s                   |
| 8th        | 128s             | 255s                   |
| 9th        | 256s             | 511s                   |
| 10th       | 409s (secondary) | 818s (secondary)       |
| 11th       | 410s (secondary) | None                   |

### Apply modifications to the records being passed to `@ERROR` label

`Filter` plugins such as `filter_record_trans_former` can modify the contents of records
before the output.

If an error occurred in `Output` plugin such that records were passed to `@ERROR` label,
records were passed with the contents before being modified.

In this release, records reflecting those modifications are now passed to `@ERROR` label.

See [#3631](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3631) for more information.

### Miscellaneous fixes

* Support IPv6 address for `rpc_endpoint` in `sytem` config. [#3641](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3641).
* Fix some typo of metric names. [#3630](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3630), [#3673](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3673).
* Declare `null_value_pattern` as `regexp`. [#3650](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3650).
* CI: Support Ruby 3.1 except Windows. [#3619](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3619).
* Fix `CHANGELOG.md` heading styles. [#3648](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3648).
* Switch to GitHub Discussions. [#3654](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3654).

Enjoy logging!
