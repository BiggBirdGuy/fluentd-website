# Fluentd v0.14.16 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v0.14.16. Here are the changes ([full ChangeLog is available here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)):
This release is mainly for fixing regressions.

We say again, fluentd v0.14 is still development version. We need your feedback!
If you try v0.14, check your configuration and plugins carefully.

### Allow null character in double-quoted string

You can use null character `\0` with double-quoted string.
This is useful for delimiter, e.g. tcp input, tsv parser, etc.
Here is an example:

    <source>
      @type tail
      path /path/to/app.log
      tag tail.test
      format tsv
      keys a,b,c
      delimiter "\0" # \0 or '\0' doesn't work
    </source>

### Major bug fixes

* out\_forward: Call proper method for each connection type
* in\_monitor\_agent: check variable buffer is a Buffer instance

Enjoy logging!
