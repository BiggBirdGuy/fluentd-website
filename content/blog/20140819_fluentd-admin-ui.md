# Fluentd-UI: Managing Fluentd from a Browser

Over the last three years, Fluentd has helped [various organizations](/testimonials) unify their logging infrastructure. As our user base grew, it became clear that diving into a command line to set up the first Fluentd instance can be a bit daunting.

So, we enlisted the help of [a badass Rails engineer](https://github.com/uu59) to create a **browser-based admin UI for Fluentd**. Pictures are worth a thousand words, so here is what it looks like:

With Fluentd-UI, starting, stopping, configuring, restarting Fluentd is only a few clicks away in your browser.

You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-ui), and as always, feel free to ask us questions on [our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fluentd)!
