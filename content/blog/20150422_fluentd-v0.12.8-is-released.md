# Fluentd v0.12.8 is released

Hi users!

We have released Fluentd version 0.12.8.
Here are the changes:

### New features / Enhancement

* output: Support millisecond flush span for try\_flush\_interval and queued\_chunk\_flush\_interval: [#568](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/568)
* filter\_record\_transformer: Support fields which start with `@`: [#574](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/574)
* config: Add final attribute to prevent config overwritten by subclass: [#583](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/583)

### Bug fixes

* config: Fix embedded code parsing: [#564](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/564)
* out\_forward: Resend chunks on dropped connection when wait ACK: [#580](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/580)

### Support millisecond flush span for try\_flush\_interval and queued\_chunk\_flush\_interval

Buffers are now flushed within millisecond unit.
In earlier versions, minimum buffer flush span was 1 second.

Default `try_flush_interval` and `queued_chunk_flush_interval` are still 1 second,
but you can specify millisecond value like `0.1`.<br />
For example, DeNA uses `try_flush_interval 0.1` and `queued_chunk_flush_interval 0.01` parameters.

Note that this is useful for low latency data transfer but there is a trade-off between throughput and latency. Default values are enough on almost cases.

<br />
<br />
Happy logging!
