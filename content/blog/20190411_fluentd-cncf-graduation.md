# Fluentd has Graduated!

We are thrilled to announce that [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org) has become the sixth [CNCF Graduated Project](https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2019/04/11/cncf-announces-fluentd-graduation)! This is a huge recognition to the project and its community. Fluentd wide adoption by the Enterprise and contributions are in a continuous grow:  we have more than 900 contributed plugins and more than 100k downloads a day!

_Fluentd was created in 2011 by [Sadayuki “Sada” Furuhashi](http://github.com/frsyuki), co-founder of [Treasure Data, Inc.](https://www.treasuredata.com/), as an open source data collector for building a [Unified Logging Layer](https://www.fluentd.org/blog/unified-logging-layer), which unifies the data collection and consumption for better use and understanding of data. In November 2016, Fluentd was accepted as CNCF’s sixth hosted project after Kubernetes, Prometheus, and OpenTracing._

As of today, [Fluentd](https://fluentd.org) is used by major companies to solve log collection and processing at scale: Microsoft, Redhat, and Google are a few names of its known users.

Fluentd's core maintainer, [Masahiro Nakagawa](https://github.com/repeatedly) (well known as [@repeatedly](https://twitter.com/repeatedly) on Twitter), said that he's thrilled to have had the opportunity to collaborate with the CNCF community and to grow its user base, and it's an honor to see Fluentd graduated. Today we celebrate this big accomplishment, and we continue looking forward to improving on upcoming Logging and data processing challenges.
