# Fluentd v1.16.5 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.16.5 on 2024-03-27. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1165---20240327).

The previous version v1.16.4 has a serious Buffer bug when it processes large data exceeding chunk size limit.
So, we have released v1.16.5 urgently, and have fixed the bug.
So, **please don't use v1.16.4**.

Sorry for troubling.

## Bug Fixes

### Buffer: Fix emit error of v1.16.4 sometimes failing to process large data exceeding chunk size limit

In the previous version v1.16.4, we fixed a Buffer bug (Please see [Fluentd v1.16.4 has been released](fluentd-v1.16.4-have-been-released) for details).

There was a race condition problem with that fix, and similar Buffer errors explained in [Fluentd v1.16.4 has been released](fluentd-v1.16.4-have-been-released) could occur.

* `emit transaction failed: ...`
* `send an error event stream to @ERROR: ...`

These errors are the same as the Buffer error of [Fluentd v1.16.4 has been released](fluentd-v1.16.4-have-been-released), but it would be more likely to happen.
The cause is a race condition when processing large data exceeding chunk size limit.
So, in that case, these errors can occur depending on the timing.

So, please don't use v1.16.4.

See [#4447](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4447) for more information.

Sorry for troubling.
