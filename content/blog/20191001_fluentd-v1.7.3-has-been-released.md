# Fluentd v1.7.3 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.7.3. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release is mainly for fixing socket cache bug of out_forward.

### in\_syslog: Replace `priority_key` with `severity_key`

`in_syslog`'s `priority_key` parameter is misleading name because it sets severity, not priority value.
So we add `severity_key` parameter.

```
<source>
  @type syslog
  severity_key severity
  tag syslog
</source>
```

`priority_key` is still supported for existing users but
we will remove `priority_key` parameter at fluentd v2.

### Major bug fixes

- out\_forward: Fix `nil` error after purge obsoleted socket in socket cache

Enjoy logging!
