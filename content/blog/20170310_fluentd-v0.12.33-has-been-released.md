## parser\_syslog: Support RFC5424 format

`parser_syslog` now supports RFC5424 format. Here is the result of RFC5424 format message:

```
# Incoming message
<16>1 2017-02-06T13:14:15.003Z 192.168.0.1 fluentd 11111 ID24224 [exampleSDID@20224 iut="3" eventSource="Application" eventID="11211"] Hi, from Fluentd!
# Parsed result
{"pri" => 16, "host" => "192.168.0.1", "ident" => "fluentd", "pid" => "11111", "msgid" => "ID24224", "extradata" => "[exampleSDID@20224 iut=\"3\" eventSource=\"Application\" eventID=\"11211\"]", "message" => "Hi, from Fluentd!"}
```

By default, `parser_syslog` assumes incoming message is RFC3614 format. You can parse RFC5424 format by setting `message_format rfc5424` in parser configuration. <br />
In addition, you can use `message_format auto` to handle two message formats in one stream. `parser_syslog` detects message format automatically and parse it.

Of course, you can use this feature in `in_syslog` because `in_syslog` uses `parser_syslog` internally.

```aconf
<source>
  @type syslog
  @id in_syslog
  message_format rfc5424
  tag system.syslog
</source>
```

## in\_tail: Add 2 features

We added `limit_recently_modified` parameter. This is useful when use `*` in the path.
If target files are not updated within `limit_recently_modified`, such files are ignored from watching list.

Another one is adding `skip_refresh_on_startup` parameter. By default, `in_tail` reads file content during startup when you set `read_from_head true` or after restarted. <br />
The problem is this is done by main thread, so it blocks other startup routines.
This is no problem when unread lines are small. But it is huge, consuming lines takes long time.
`skip_refresh_on_startup` parameter delays the watching list update so useful for above case.


<br />
Lastly, v0.12.33 docker image has also been [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/tags).

<br />
Happy logging!
