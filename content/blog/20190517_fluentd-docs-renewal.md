# Fluentd documentation is now hosted on gitbook

Today, we have updated [docs.fluentd.org](https://docs.fluentd.org) to use gitbook.
This change has several merits:

- Better Look and Feel (same as fluent-bit document)
- Use popular Markdown for the content
- Reduce maintenance cost

[fluentd-docs-gitbook](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-docs-gitbook) is new repository and
old [fluentd-docs](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-docs) repository is now deprecated and archived.

If you find something wrong on docs.fluentd.org, use fluentd-docs-gitbook for issues/PRs.
