# Fluentd v0.10.55 is released

Hi users!

We have just released Fluentd version 0.10.55. We forgot cherry-picking one commit so version 0.10.54 is skipped.<br />
Here are the changes:

* config: Change v1's non-quoted string literal behaviour to v0's behaviour: [#436](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/436)
* config: Relax '@' handling in the plugin configuration for backward compatibility: [#455](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/455)
* config: Add --use-v0-config for keeping old configuration: [#434](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/434)
* config: Add single quoted literal in v1 configuration: [#437](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/437)
* config: Improve error message of Array / Hash parse error: [#457](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/457)
* input: Reduce shutdown time in some network related plugins when use Cool.io 1.2: [#440](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/440)
* parser: Use ParserError instead of general exception classes: [#453](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/453)
* Remove unused zfile buffer plugin: [#445](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/445)

This release improves and changes v1 configuration.

### Change v1's non-quoted string literal behaviour

Old v1's non-quoted string literal is same as double-quoted string literal so v1-config user should escape some characters, e.g. `\`, with `\`. It has a problem which hard to write regular expression and hard to migrate from v0-config.
After several discussion, we decided to change v1's non-quoted string literal behaviour to v0's non-quoted string. You don't need `\` escape in the non-quoted string.

In this result, you can easy to migrate from v0 to v1 configuration. This is good for existence Fluentd and td-agent users. We will add each string literal explanation to configuration article on <a href="//docs.fluentd.org">Fluentd document</a>.

This change breaks backward compatibility of --use-v1-config. If you already use `--use-v1-config` or td-agent 2, see this thread for avoiding incompatible problem: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fluentd/4C36iAyI87E

### Add --use-v0-config option

Fluentd v0.12 or later uses v1 configuration by default. If you want to keep v0 configuration, this option is useful.


Happy logging!
