Hi users!

We have released td-agent v4.4.0. td-agent is a stable distribution package of Fluentd.

### Changes from td-agent v4.3.2

  * Update bundled Fluentd from v1.14.6 to v1.15.1. Please see each release announcement of Fluentd for more detail:
    * [Fluentd v1.15.0 has been released](fluentd-v1.15.0-has-been-released)
