# Fluentd v0.12.31 has been released

Hi users!

We have released Fluentd version 0.12.31.
Here are the changes:

### New features / Enhancement

* output: Add `slow_flush_log_threshold` parameter: [#1366](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/1366)
* formatter\_csv: Change fields parameter to required. Now accepts both `a,b` and `["a", "b"]`: [#1361](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/1361)
* in\_syslog: Add `priority_key` and `facility_key` parameters: [#1351](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/1351)

## Add `slow_flush_log_threshold` parameter

We introduce `slow_flush_log_threshold` parameter to investigate flush performance issue. Fluentd users sometimes hit `BufferQueueLimitError` without errors. In such case, users hard to find the cause, traffic is high or output destination becomes slow?

With this parameter, users can know output destination has a problem or not. If you see following message in the fluentd log, your output destination or network has a problem and it causes slow chunk flush.

```
2016-12-19 12:00:00 +0000 [warn]: buffer flush took longer time than slow_flush_log_threshold: elapsed_time=15.0031226690043695 slow_flush_log_threshold=10.0 plugin_id="es_output"
```

In this example, `slow_flush_log_threshold` is `10.0` but chunk flush takes `15` seconds.

```aconf
<match app.**>
  @type elasticsearch
  @id es_output
  slow_flush_log_threshold 10.0
  # ...
</filter>
```

The default value is `20.0`. If your buffer chunk is small and network latency is low, set smaller value for better monitoring.


<br />
Lastly, v0.12.31 docker image has also been [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/tags).

<br />
Happy logging!
