# Fluentd Will Be at RubyConf 2014!

Great news: Fluentd will be at [RubyConf 2014](http://rubyconf.org/program#prop_569) next month! In fact, if we count our sister project [Norikra](http://norikra.github.io/), there will be not only one but TWO Fluentd-related talks at RubyConf =)

Many of Fluentd's core contributors will be at the event. In addition to the two speakers <a href="//github.com/tagomoris">@tagomoris</a> and <a href="//github.com/kiyoto">@kiyoto</a>, the main maintainer <a href="//github.com/repeatedly">@repeatedly</a> will be hanging around to answer your questions.

Happy log collecting, and we look forward to seeing you in San Diego!
