Satoshi is one of the core maintainers of Fluentd and a prolific [Fluentd plugin](/plugins/all) author. As of this writing, he has **29 plugins to his credit with over 280k total downloads**. His latest project is [Norikra](http://norikra.github.io/), a schemaless SQL-like stream processing engine that runs atop Fluentd.

According to Satoshi, there is a vibrant Fluentd community in Singapore, and he was pleased to see many of them in the audience.

Do check out his slides! They cover both the fundamentals of Fluentd and real-world use cases/deployment models for Fluentd. Super informative.
