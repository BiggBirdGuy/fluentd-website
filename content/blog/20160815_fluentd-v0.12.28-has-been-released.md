# Fluentd v0.12.28 has been released

Hi users!

We have released Fluentd version 0.12.28.
Here are the changes:

### New features / Enhancement

* in\_forward: Add `source_hostname_key` parameter: [#807](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/807)

### Bug fixes

* parser: Ensure strict mode is used for Oj parser: [#1147](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/1147)

## in\_forward: Add `source_hostname_key` parameter

This parameter is useful when your forwarders hard to add hostname or comparing hostname for debugging, See [this comment](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/804#issuecomment-184680949).

When this parameter is specified, `in_forward` iterates / mutates incoming events and it needs additional processing resource. If your environment is very high traffic, check the performance first.

## parser: Ensure strict mode is used for Oj parser

Oj parser treats `:` started string as a symbol, not string. It causes plugins raise an error like "undefined method \`strip' for #\<Symbol:0x000000033f370c\>".

v0.12.28 fixes this problem.


<br />
Lastly, v0.12.28 docker image has also been [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/tags).

<br />
Happy logging!
