* in\_debug\_agent: Fix config\_param type of unix\_path: [#392](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/392)

* engine: Reduce memory usage when retry\_limit is large: [#388](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/388)
* parser: Add apache\_error format: [#396](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/396)
* supervisor: Dump Fluentd version at dry run mode: [#384](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/384)
* test: InputTestDriver wait 'run' until input plugin emits all test data: [#397](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/397)

This release fixed several bugs and added several useful options.

### apache\_error format

Fluentd parser provides `apache_error` format as a built-in.
Some users collect Apache error logs using Fluentd on production, so
supporting this format seems useful for other users.

### disable\_retry\_limit option

This is for buffered output plugins. If you set `disable_retry_limit` to `true`,
output tries to retry forever and `<secondary>` is never called.

You can simulate same behaviour using very large value with `retry_limit` but
`disable_retry_limit` is more clear.

## Started v0.12 development in master branch

After released v0.10.53, master branch is now for [v0.12](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/wiki/V1-Roadmap#v012-august).<br />
We are now developing Filter and Label feature on [this PR](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/416).

If you have v0.10 specific problem,
please send PR to [v0.10 branch](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/tree/v0.10) or open an issue with [v0.10 label](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/labels/v0.10).

Happy logging!
