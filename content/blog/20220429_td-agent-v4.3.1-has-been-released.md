### About packages for latest distributions

Although Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) is already released, we don't yet provide the official td-agent package for it. An experimental package which bundles Ruby 3.1 is [work in progress](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-package-builder/pull/381).

### End of life announcement

  * The package for Ubuntu xenial won't be provided from the next minor update (td-agent 4.4.0) because Ubuntu 16.04.x had already reached to [End of Standard Support](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).
  * [td-agent 3 series won't be maintained anymore](schedule-for-td-agent-3-eol).
