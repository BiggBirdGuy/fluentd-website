# Fluentd v1.15.3 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.15.3 on 2022-11-02. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1153---20221102).

In this release, we fixed several bugs.

## Bug Fixes

### `out_file`: Fix the multi-worker check with `<worker N-M>` directive

In the v1.15.1, we added a new feature to prevent write conflicts between multiple workers.

* [#3808](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3808)

However, this fix didn't work correctly with `<worker N-M>` directive.

* [`<worker N-M>` directive](https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/multi-process-workers#less-than-worker-n-m-greater-than-directive)

With this setting, the configuration check before starting the supervisor mistakenly determines
that the setting of `out_file` is invalid and causes Fluentd to terminate.

In this release, we fixed this problem.

See [#3942](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3942) for more information.

### Fix log rotation on Windows

We can configure log rotation setting as follows.

* [Log Rotation Setting](https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/logging#log-rotation-setting)

On Windows, the log files must be separated by each process.

> NOTE: When --log-rotate-age is specified on Windows, log files are separated into
> log-supervisor-0.log, log-0.log, ..., log-N.log where N is generation - 1 due to the system limitation.
> Windows does not permit delete and rename files simultaneously owned by another process.

However, that log rotation setting in the system-directive didn't satisfy this and
Fluentd outputed the logs of the supervisor process into the log file of the worker-0 process.

This could cause errors during log rotation.

In this release, we fixed this problem.

See [#3939](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3939) for more information.

### Support glob for `!include` directive in YAML config format

In the v1.15.0, we supported YAML config format.

* [Config File Syntax (YAML)](https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/config-file-yaml)
* [#3712](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3712)

However, handling glob of `!include` directive was leaked.

In this release, we supported it.

See [#3917](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3917) for more information.

### Remove meaningless and unsecure `oj` options

In this release, we removed the following `oj` options.

* `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object`
* `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MAX_NESTING`

`FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object` was unsecure, so we removed it.

* [GHSA-fppq-mj76-fpj2](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/security/advisories/GHSA-fppq-mj76-fpj2)

This option is not used unless a user explicitly sets the environmental variable,
so almost all users do not need to care about this vulnerability.

`FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MAX_NESTING` was not supported, so we removed it.

* https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/3311#issuecomment-923741031

See [#3929](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3929) for more information.

Enjoy logging!
