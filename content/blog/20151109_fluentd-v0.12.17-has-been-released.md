Hi users!

We have released Fluentd version 0.12.17.
Here are the changes:

* filter\_record\_transformer: Don't use popular name to prevent field overwrite when `enable_ruby` is `true` [#687](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/687)

## Engine: Add `Engine#msgpack_factory` for v0.14 compatibility

Since v0.14, we provide `Engine#msgpack_factory` API for creating MessagePack packer/unpacker.
This is for supporting nano-second time in fluentd event.
For support both v0.12 and v0.14 in plugins, we can use `Engine#msgpack_factory`.

- Old (v0.12.16 or earlier)

```rb
packer = MesasgePack::Packer.new
unpacker = MessagePack::Unpacker.new(io)
```

- New (v0.12.17 or later)

```rb
packer = Fluent::Engine.msgpack_factory.packer
unpacker = Fluent::Engine.msgpack_factory.unpacker(io)
```

## Log shutdown plugin info to check shutdown sequence

Fluentd now dumps plugin shutdown log like below.

```
...
2015-10-27 18:36:53 +0900 [info]: shutting down fluentd
2015-10-27 18:36:53 +0900 [info]: shutting down input type = "forward" plugin_id = "foo"
2015-10-27 18:36:53 +0900 [info]: shutting down filter in @FOO type = "grep" plugin_id = "object:3fe8b48ffef8"
2015-10-27 18:36:53 +0900 [info]: shutting down output in @FOO type = "stdout" plugin_id = "object:3fe8b48fbd44"
2015-10-27 18:36:53 +0900 [info]: shutting down filter type = "record_transformer" plugin_id = "object:3fe8b48f3ec8"
2015-10-27 18:36:53 +0900 [info]: shutting down output type = "stdout" plugin_id = "object:3fe8b48f2dac"
2015-10-27 18:36:54 +0900 [info]: process finished code = 0
```

This is useful for checking what the plugin takes long time to shutdown.


Happy logging!
