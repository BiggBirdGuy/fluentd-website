# Fluentd v1.10.0 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.10.0. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release includes new sd plugin and some enhancements.

### Add sd_srv plugin

You can manage the service list via DNS SRV record.

See official article: https://docs.fluentd.org/service_discovery/srv

### parser\_syslog: Improve `time_format` handling

parser\_syslog now handles non-standard `time_format` like below:

- log example

```
2020-03-03T10:14:29Z 192.168.0.1 fluentd[11111]: [error] Syslog test
```

- parser configuration example in in\_syslog

```
<parse>
  # Non RFC3164 time format. It doesn't work before.
  time_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ
</parse>
```

### in\_dummy: Delete `suspend` parameter

This parameter is for old in\_dummy implementation.
`suspend` feature is automatically handled by the storage plugin.

### Major bug fixes

- buffer: Fix `available_buffer_space_ratio` calculation
- windows: Permit to specify `linger_timeout` in out\_forward
- tls: Support CRLF based X.509 certificates

Enjoy logging!
