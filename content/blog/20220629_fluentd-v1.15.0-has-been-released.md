# Fluentd v1.15.0 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.15.0. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1150---20220629).

This release is a new release of v1.15 series.

In this release, we added some new functions and fixed some crash bugs, especially about `in_tail`.

## Enhancement

### Support YAML configuration format

Fluentd now supports YAML configuration format as follows.

```yaml
config:
  - source:
      $type: forward
      port: 24224
  - source:
      $type: http
      port: 9880
  - match:
      $tag: myapp.access
      $type: file
      path: /var/log/fluent/access
```

This is not 1-by-1 correspondence for the traditional Fluentd config file syntax.

Please see [the document](https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/config-file-yaml) for detailed usage instructions
or see [#3712](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3712) for more information.

### `in_tail`: Add log throttling in files based on group rules

In this release, we add a new option directive `group` to `in_tail`.

From v1.13, We can use `read_bytes_limit_per_second` to throttle log flow rate, but we can only
set it for each `source` unit.

By using this new option, we can throttle log flow rate for each file unit.

Please see [the document](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail#less-than-group-greater-than-section) for detailed usage instructions
or see [#3535](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3535) for more information.

### Add `restart_worker_interval` to system configuration

In this release, we add a new option `restart_worker_interval`.

By default, Fluentd immediately restarts stopped workers, but you may want to keep the worker
stopped for a while for some reason. In such cases, you can use this option as follows.

```
<system>
  restart_worker_interval 1m
</system>
```

By this setting, a stopped worker will restart after 1 minute.

See [#3768](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3768) for more information.

### `fluent-ctl`: Add a new command `dump`

In this release, we can use a new command `dump` in `fluent-ctl`.

This command is mainly for Windows.

As for non-Windows, you can manually send SIGCONT to each supervisor/worker process to dump their
internal status. ([Dump fluentd's Internal Information](https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/trouble-shooting#dump-fluentds-internal-information))

By using this new command, we can get the internal status on Windows too.

On Windows, this makes all Fluentd processes (including all worker processes) dump their internal
status to the system temp directory (`C:\\Windows\\Temp`).

```console
$ fluent-ctl dump [PID_OR_SVCNAME]
```

You can omit `[PID_OR_SVCNAME]` if you run the fluentd as a Windows service, whose service name is
the default value `fluentdwinsvc`.

Please see [the document](https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/command-line-option#about-dump) for detailed usage instructions
or see [#3680](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3680) for more information.
