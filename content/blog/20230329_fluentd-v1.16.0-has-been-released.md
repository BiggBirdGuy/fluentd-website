# Fluentd v1.16.0 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.16.0 on 2023-03-29. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1160---20230329).

This release is a new release of v1.16 series.
In this release, we enhanced the feature for chunk file corruption and fixed some bugs, mainly about logging and race condition errors.

## Enhancement

### Backup corrupted chunk files at resuming

Some chunk files in [buffer_file](https://docs.fluentd.org/buffer/file) or [buffer\_file\_single](https://docs.fluentd.org/buffer/file_single) are possibly corrupted after Fluentd stopped abnormally, such as due to a power failure.

Fluentd has a feature to backup unrecoverable chunks as before.
However, when Fluentd resumes, remaining corrupted chunk files were just deleted.

Since this release, Fluentd also backups those files at resuming.
In addition, Fluentd outputs some useful logs about possibly corrupted chunk files due to an abnormal termination.

Please see [the document](https://docs.fluentd.org/buffer#detecting-chunk-file-corruption-when-fluentd-starts-up) and the following PRs for more information.

* [buffer: backup broken file chunk](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4025)
* [Add warning messages for restoring buffer with `flush_at_shutdown true`](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4027)
* [Add logs for time period of restored buffer possibly broken](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/4028)

### `in_tcp`: Add `send_keepalive_packet` option

Since this release, you can use [send\_keepalive\_packet option](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tcp#general-configuration) for `in_tcp`, as well as [in_forward](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/forward) or [in_syslog](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/syslog).

Please see [the document](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tcp#general-configuration) and [#3961](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3961) for more information.
