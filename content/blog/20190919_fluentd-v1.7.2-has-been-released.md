# Fluentd v1.7.2 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.7.2. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release includes several fixes.

### in\_tcp: Add `security/client` to restrict access

This is similar to `in_forward`. You can limit the client by host/network.
Here is configuration example:

```
<source>
  @type tcp
  # other parameters...
  <security>
    <client>
      host app_server1.com
    </client>
    <client>
      host web_server1.com
    </client>
  </security>
</source>
```

With this configuration, `in_tcp` rejects the data from other hosts, e.g. `app_server2.com`.

### Major bug fixes

- buf\_file/buf\_file\_single: fix to handle compress data during restart
- plugin: Use `__send__` to avoid conflict with user defined `send` method

Enjoy logging!
