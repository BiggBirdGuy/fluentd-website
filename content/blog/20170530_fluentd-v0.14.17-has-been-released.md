# Fluentd v0.14.17 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v0.14.17. Here are the changes ([full ChangeLog is available here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)):
This release is mainly for bug fixes.

We say again, fluentd v0.14 is still development version. We need your feedback!
If you try v0.14, check your configuration and plugins carefully.

### server: Accept private key for TLS server without passphrase

The `private_key_passphrase` and `ca_private_key_passphrase` for TLS setting are now optional.
It means you can use private key without passphrase in server plugin helper based plugins, e.g. `in_forward`/`out_forward`. 

### Major bug fixes

* out\_forward: Fix ack handling
* config: Mask all secret parameters in worker section

This version fixed `out_forward`'s `require_ack_response` regressions.
If you use `require_ack_response` with v0.14, we recommend to update fluentd v0.14 to v0.14.17.

Enjoy logging!
