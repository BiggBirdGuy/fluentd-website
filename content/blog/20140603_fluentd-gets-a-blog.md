# Fluentd Gets a Blog!

Hi everyone!

Fluentd has a new website and a blog. This blog serves as a place to announce major decisions and events and engage with the community.

Right now it is very barebone. For example, it does not yet have an RSS. [Fluentd will be twittering about updates on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fluentd). Also, you can [sign up for Fluentd Newsletters](http://go.treasuredata.com/Fluentd_education) curated and published by Treasure Data.

For starters, I want to point people to some of our new content and popular existing content:

* [EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana): Free Alternative to Splunk](http://docs.fluentd.org/articles/free-alternative-to-splunk-by-fluentd)
* [Slideshare Case Study: Fluentd as a Versatile Message Bus](/casestudy/slideshare)
* [Parsing Maillogs and Storing Them into MongoDB with Fluentd](/guides/recipes/maillog-mongodb)

Happy Logging!
