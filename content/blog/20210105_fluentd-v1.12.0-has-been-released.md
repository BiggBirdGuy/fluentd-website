# Fluentd v1.12.0 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.12.0. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### `in_tail`: Support `*` in `path` with log rotation

fluentd v1.12.0 resolves the limitation for `*` with log rotation.
`follow_inodes true` enables the combination of `*` in path with log rotation inside same directory
and `read_from_head true` without log duplication problem.

```
path /path/to/*
read_from_head true
follow_inodes true  # without this parameter, log rotation may cause log duplication
```

### `in_tail`: Support Linux Capability

Fluentd supports Linux capability via `capng_c` gem and
`in_tail` now supports `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`/`CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` capabilities to read log files.

See official article for more details: [Linux Capability](https://docs.fluentd.org/deployment/linux-capability)

If you want more capability support in official plugins, file it on github.

### Add `fluent-ctl` command

`fluent-ctl` provides same interface to control fluentd process, `shutdown`/`restart`/`flush`/`reload`.

- On Linux, `fluent-ctl` uses Signals
- On Windows, `fluent-ctl` uses Windows Event

Command example:

```
# Usage: fluent-ctl action PID
$ fluent-ctl shutdown 11111
```

### Major bug fixes

* output: Prevent `retry.step` from being called too many times in a short time

Enjoy logging!
