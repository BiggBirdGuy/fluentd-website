Hi users!

We have released v1.12.4. This release is a maintenance release of v1.12 series.
ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/v1.12.4/CHANGELOG.md#release-v1124---20210526).

### `in_tail`: Fix a bug that refresh_watcher fails to handle file rotations

In the previous Fluentd v1.11.x implementation uses path based tailing keys.
Since v1.12, `follow_inodes` feature is introduced, but as a side effects unexpectedly,
 refresh_watcher tend to fail to handle file rotations correctly.

This version contains a fix for the issue only. [#3393](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/3393)

Enjoy logging!
