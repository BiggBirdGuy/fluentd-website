# NodeJS: Fluent-Logger v0.3 have been released

[Fluentd](http://fluentd.org) as an enterprise solution for data collection is getting a lot of traction, and not only on common server side applications, also on [Docker Containers](https://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/systems-management/851727-docker-and-logging) and inside the [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org) ecosystem.

For [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org) developers, the package [fluent-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fluent-logger) is available so you can unify your logging layer easily. Today we have updated the package with a couple of fixes for it build dependencies. We made this version compatible with NodeJS < 4.x,  as it's where most of the production users runs on (for compatibility with NodeJS >= 4, please check the [nodejs-4](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-node/tree/nodejs-4) branch).

I cannot close this post without mention that we are happy that this package have been downloaded more than __70k times__ this year!, definitely [Fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org) is becoming the defacto logging layer solution everywhere.
