# Fluentd v0.12.19 has been released

Hi users!

We have released Fluentd version 0.12.19.
Here are the changes:

### New features / Enhancement

* input: Standardize logging level for source configs: [743](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/743)
* buffer: Add `buffer_queue_full_action` parameter: [745](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/745)
* parser/formatter: Use `oj` when oj is installed in json parser/formatter: [748](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/748)

### Bug fixes

* fluent-cat: Fix the regression of `--msgpack` option: [747](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/747)

## `buffer_queue_full_action` parameter in buffers

By default, Fluentd's buffer raises `BufferQueueLimitError` when buffer queue becomes full. This is fit for streaming manner, e.g. `in_forward` returns error response to `out_forward` and `out_forward` can handle such error.

On the other hand, blocking action instead of raising error is sometimes useful, e.g. `in_tail` and `out_elasticsearch` for mini-batch use.

To support above 2 cases, we introduce `buffer_queue_full_action` parameter in buffers. Currently, there are 2 values.

```
buffer_queue_full_action exception # default. existing behaviour
buffer_queue_full_action block # block input processing
```

If you set `buffer_queue_full_action block` in buffered output configuration, input blocks emit records until buffer full is resolved.

We support `buffer_queue_full_action` but we don't recommend to use `block` action first. Please consider improving destination setting to resolve `BufferQueueLimitError` or use `@ERROR` label for routing overflowed events to another backup destination. If you sometimes hit `BufferQueueLimitError`, it means your destination capacity is not fit for your traffic.

Lastly, we are now considering back-pressure support in the future. It will resolve above problem smartly.

## Use `oj` for performance improvement when it is installed

[oj](https://github.com/ohler55/oj) is very fast json library in Ruby. Fluentd uses `yajl` by default but if you install `oj` in your rubygems, Fluentd uses `oj` instead of `yajl` for better parsing / formatting performance. Using `oj` is 1.5x faster in in_tail case([See PR](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/pull/748)).

In our tests, there are no big differences between `oj` and `yajl`. But if you hit some troubles or want to keep to use `yajl`, set `json_parser yajl` in your plugin configuration.

<br />
Lastly, v0.12.19 docker image has also been [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/tags).

<br />
Happy logging!
