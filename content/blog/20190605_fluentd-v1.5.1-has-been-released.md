# Fluentd v1.5.1 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.5.1. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release includes several enhancements and bug fixes.

### in\_tail: Increase read block size to reduce IO call

We changed read block size from 2048 to 8192. 2048 is small for large logs.
`in_tail` uses `IO#readpartial` method and the overhead of this method is bit higher.
So decreasing the number of method call reduces CPU usage.

### Major bug fixes

* out\_forward: Fix the socket handling of keepalive
* parser: Fix the use of name based timezone
* in_monitor_agent: Fix debug parameter handling

Enjoy logging!
