# Fluentd v1.2.2 has been released

Hi users!

We have released v1.2.2. ChangeLog is [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This release is mainly for bug fixes.

## filter\_parser: Add `remove_key_name_field` parameter

With `reserve_data true`, `key_name` field is kept in the record.

Original record:

```
{"k1":"v1","log":"{\"k2\":\"v2\"}"}
```

Parsed result:

```
{"k1":"v1","log":"{\"k2\":\"v2\"}","k2":"v2"}
```

But we often don't need original `key_name` field when parsing is succeeded.
You can remove `key_name` field with `remove_key_name_field true`.
Parsed result is below:

```
{"k1":"v1","k2":"v2"}
```

### Major bug fixes

* buffer: Wait for all chunks being purged before deleting `@queued_num` items


Thanks for submitting bug reports and patches :)

Enjoy logging!
